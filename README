This is a simple journaling app for Android. I started this project more to
teach myself some Android app development.

This project is currently in a buildable, runable state. The core functions,
i.e. Database creation, query, and writing, and creating a new entry are 
intact and working, at least minimally. On the other hand, there is still
a LOT of work to do! For starters, I need to make the MainActivity update and
show the newly created entry after return from the create entry activity. For
full TO-DO's, see TO-DO.
