To-Do's for MyJournal

    * (CRITICAL) Fix loading of entries. Entries read from db properly, but get stored into
                 ArrayList<JournalEntry> improperly, causing all entries to show the same
                 title and date on the main list view
    * Make entries list view load older entries when scrolled down, if older entries exist
    * Make entries list view selectable to allow for editing of old entries
    * Adapt edit entries activity to allow for editing of old entries
    * Adapt edit entries activity, or add new activity, to allow view only mode for old entries
    * Adapt entries list view to allow user to choose between view or edit
    * Adjust layouts/general UI cleanup
    * Adjust entries list view to show entries in bigger text, improving visibility
